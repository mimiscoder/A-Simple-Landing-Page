# A-Simple-Landing-Page

## Personal Feeling

Yay! I finally made a full layout for a single-page website. As always, I'm really proud of myself for all the coding I did (I said it like I wrote the code for an operating system or something, lol). I don't think it was hard. In my opinion, it was somewhere between easy and medium levels of difficulty. I used the magical flexbox tool for laying out different sections of my website. That can help you build small- to medium-sized layouts quite easily. Overall, I felt very good doing this project, as I was really excited and enjoyed it from start to finish.

## Project Description

Get ready for the real staff here! This website was the second project that was given as our assignment to do in the Foundation Course of TOP (The Odin Project). It was a full layout for a single-page website that has different sections.

These sections are:
- A hero section  
- Information section  
- Quote section  
- Call-to-action section  
- Footer  

Each of these section has their own sub-sections as well.

## Challanges

I will say it was easy. There wasn't anything that really tripped me out really hard or faced any big problems. Overall, I didn't face any major challenges with this project.

## Learning Experience

- It strengthened my understanding of Flexbox. 
- It helped me learn how to make cool layouts like this with flexbox.
